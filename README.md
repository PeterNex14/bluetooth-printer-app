# 🖨️ PrintTokenApp
A simple Android application that allows users to print electricity tokens via a Bluetooth thermal printer.

## 💡 Why I Created This App
I built this app to help my mom print electricity tokens more easily at home.
Instead of going through complex menus or lists, she can simply:
1. Press Print
2. Select the printer from a simple bottom sheet
3. Automatically print the token in a clear, easy-to-read format

The focus was on simplicity, avoiding unnecessary UI complexity, and making the printing process effortless for non-technical users.

## 🚀 Features
- Discover and connect to paired Bluetooth printers
- Print formatted electricity tokens
- Simple UI with Bottom Sheet printer selection
- Text formatting (bold, big font, center alignment) for clear readability
